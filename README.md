# Pipx Install Action

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) packages using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) with [cache support](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Use this action to install Python packages using pipx, especially for tools written in Python that should be installed in isolated environments.
After installation, this action will automatically save the installed packages to a cache to speed up installations for subsequent workflow runs.

## Key Features

- Installs Python packages using pipx.
- Caches Python package installations to be used in subsequent workflow runs.
